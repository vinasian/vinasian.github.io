        Hello there! I am Vincent Nguyen. I have some nicknames but "Vin" is my most common one.
        I was born in California and was raised there until 2008. From there I stayed in Arizona temporarily before moving into Florida in 2010!
        Once I ended up in Florida, I finished the rest of my general education here in Fort Myers. I decided to stay here and apply for FGCU for various reasons like the community and the software engineering major.

	    I love to play video games. The games I play hit a lot of genres, like fighting games, horror, action, RPG, and so much more.
	    My passion for video games concidently led me to gain interest computers, specfically computer hardware. I am a huge AMD fanboy because underdogs rule (also their hardware have much better value then Intel)!
	    Also I like looking around houses I haven't been in...Which is why I sometimes look around a person's house looking like a thief but I just like exploring houses.
	    Although I do like meeting new people, my social skills aren't the best! I try to talk to people, but sometimes I just can't get the words out. So I use card games, because everyone loves card games, right?
